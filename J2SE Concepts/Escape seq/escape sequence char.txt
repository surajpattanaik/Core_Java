Escape Sequence Characters
-----------------------------------
- A character preceded by a backslash (\) is an escape sequence and has special meaning to the compiler. 
- A charcter that changes the original meaning is called escape character.
- Every escape character must start with \ following by single character
- When we place \ before one character some special funcationality will be added
 for example: 
 if we use n, n as it is displayed 
 System.out.println("Hari n Krishna");  O/P is Hari n Krishna
 if we place \ before n it meaning is not n it is a new line, 
 n is not displayed, rather new line is displayed 
 System.out.println("Hari \n Krishna");  O/P is Hari 
    Krishna
- After \ we can not place any character, we have only few characters
- Java supports _____ escape sequence characters
 Java suppots escape 8 sequence charcters
 Escape Sequence Description
 \f Insert a formfeed in the text at this point.
 \b Insert a backspace in the text at this point.
 \n Insert a newline in the text at this point.
 \t Insert a tab space in the text at this point.
 \r Insert a carriage return in the text at this point.
 \' Insert a single quote character in the text at this point.
 \" Insert a double quote character in the text at this point.
 \\ Insert a backslash character in the text at this point.

Program #7: Explain all above escape sequence characters funcationality with a program
 class EscapeSequence {
     public static void main(String[] args) {
   System.out.println("Hi\fHello"); 
   System.out.println("HiHello\f");
   System.out.println("\fHiHello");
   System.out.println("HRU?");
   System.out.println();
   System.out.println("Hi\bHello"); 
   System.out.println();
   System.out.println("Hi\nHello"); 
   System.out.println();
   System.out.println("Hi\tHello"); 
   System.out.println();
   System.out.println("Hi\rHello"); 
   System.out.println("HiHello\rHRU?"); 
   System.out.println("HiHelloHRU?\r");
   System.out.println("\rHiHelloHRU?");
   System.out.println();
 //          System.out.println("""); //DQ in DQ is not allowed
 //          System.out.println(''');   //SQ in SQ is not allowed
   System.out.println("\"");   
   System.out.println('\'');  
   System.out.println('"');   //In SQ DQ is allowed
   System.out.println("'");   //In DQ SQ is allowed
 //          System.out.println("\"); //HERE \ IS CONSIDERED AS ESCAPER
 //          System.out.println('\'); //HERE \ IS CONSIDERED AS ESCAPER
   System.out.println("\\"); //We must use \\ to consider \ as a \
 //          System.out.println("\\\"); 
   System.out.println("\\\\"); 
     }
